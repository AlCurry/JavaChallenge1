A simple java example, comparing array list values, more problem detail in the code.  Implemented &amp; tested in Eclipse (Mars).
 
A pet adoption agency wants to pair adult dogs with puppies.  
There are B adult dogs and D puppies. For a pairing, the adult 
dog should be larger than the puppy. Given the sizes of all of 
the dogs, determine whether it is possible for all adult dogs 
to be paired with a puppy.  Each adult dog can be paired with 
only one puppy, and each puppy can only be paired with one 
adult dog.
 
Input: 
Line 1: the number of test cases

For each test case:
Line 1: the number of adult dogs and puppies.
Line 2: D integers each representing the size of the puppies.
Line 3: B integers each representing the size of the adult dogs.

Output:
Print YES if all adult dogs can be paired with a puppy.  Otherwise print NO. 
 
Limits: 
1<= Test Cases <=10
1<= Dog Size <=10000 
1<= Size <=200
